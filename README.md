# Creating-music-tunes-using-Arduino-Uno-R3
Implementing different codes in Tinkercad platform, to produce music tunes using : Arduino Uno R3, Piezo Buzzer and Breadboard.
# Usage
Every code here should run on every arduino board without problems. The sketches rely solely on the tone() function from Arduino, so the sounds are all monophonic. On the bright side, libraries are not required.

If you want to compare the code with the original score, I try to group the notes in a measure as one line of ccode and the staves as groups of lines. However, in some cases notes will be tied together among measures or be dotted and this rule is broken.
